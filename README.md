## The project
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.7 and node v12.19.0.

This project is part of recruitment for [Divelement Web Services]("https://divelement.io"),
this is only a simple home test for github api: https://api.github.com.

### Proposed Objective
The goal of this project will be to create a web application that shows git commit history for the project youâ€™re working on (looks a lot like recursion, huh?). You need to make many well-stated commits while working on this project and regularly push them up.

You will need to sign up for a free GitHub account if you do not already have one, then create a public repository to store your work so that we will be able to see and review it. You can find documentation on the GitHub API here: https://developer.github.com/v3/.
